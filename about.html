<h1>About Del Valle Fine Arts</h1>

<p>Del Valle Fine Arts presents world class chamber music concerts at the beautiful Bankhead Theater in downtown Livermore, California.  The organization originally was formed as a vehicle for raising funds to buy a piano that would be available for use in the community.  Over the years, the focus shifted to bringing world class chamber music to the Tri-Valley area and introducing school children to classical music.</p>

<p>Del Valle Fine Arts presents five regular season concerts per year along with occasional special concerts.  Every season includes a piano recital to recognize the roots of the organization.  A string quartet is also regularly included in the season offering.  Del Valle Fine Arts is in its 38th season of presenting quality chamber music.</p>

<p>The organization is managed by volunteers and is supported by ticket sales and generous contributions of patrons.  Contributions allow the board of Del Valle Fine Arts to assure the quality of artists is outstanding.  Revenues also support free tickets for students through high school and programs in the local schools.</p>

<p>If you would like to support Del Valle Fine Arts, you can send a check to PO Box 2335, Livermore, CA 94551, or simply come to our concerts and enjoy world class chamber music.</p>
